PlayList:
	* Have name

	* A way to report what should be played
	* Know if sound is necessary
	* Automatic update content
	
	Use a construction string to define a playlist

	* Have a queue to control what should be played next
	* Can start playing a specific playable
	* Update observers and tell them how to check if audio should be used
	* Tell observers to start playing specific type of file
	
	Think about how this design should be made
