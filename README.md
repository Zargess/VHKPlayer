VHKPlayer
=========

The new video player for vhk. A more general approach.

This video player is an open source project. It is designed to the usage in handball matches to show advertisements, show videoes 
of the players, show statistics and play music during the match. Anyone is free to use this as they wish. It is however designed
for the needs of the danish handball club Viborg.

This is a C# project and .net 4.5.3 is required for running this program.

Note that the project has been restarted as the old approach was faulty.

A list of the current functions available:
<ul>
<li>Automatic updating when changes happens in the folder structure</li>
</ul>
This is a work in progress and many functions will be refined and more will come soon.
